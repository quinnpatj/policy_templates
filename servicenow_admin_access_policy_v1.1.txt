1	Purpose 
The purpose of this policy is to define the appropriate use of administrator access within the organization ServiceNow platform and to outline the actions that constitute inappropriate use of administrator access within the ServiceNow platform. This policy aims to ensure the security, integrity, and availability of systems, applications, and data by establishing guidelines for the responsible use of administrative privileges. Additionally, this policy defines key terms and roles and responsibilities associated with appropriate use of administrator access. 
This document may also relate to other controls and authoritative sources, including NIST 800-53 and OWASP publications. Where there is overlap, the source document or control informs this document and should be considered authoritative.

2	Scope
This policy applies to all organization employees, contractors, and third-party vendors who have been granted administrative rights or privileged access to the ServiceNow platform, applications, and data contained within the ServiceNow platform.

3	Audience
This standard defines a set of minimum requirements for all organization employees and, unless otherwise noted, contractors, and vendors involved with development on the organization ServiceNow platform.  This includes, but is not limited to, application owners, application security leaders, software developers, business analysts, testers, application architects, and associated IT security and compliance roles.  

4	Definitions and Acronyms
The following list contains definitions and acronyms used within this standard.
4.1	Administrative Access: Refers to elevated privileges granted to individuals that allow them to perform system configuration, maintenance, troubleshooting, and security-related activities on the ServiceNow platform.
4.2	Application: A self-contained software module or package that provides specific functionality or services to users. It is designed to address a particular business need or process within an organization and is built on top of the ServiceNow platform's underlying infrastructure and capabilities.
4.3	Application Owner: Technical owner of the application who maintains and supports the application to run effectively for business use.
4.4	BPA: Business Process Automation
4.5	Change Management: The process of controlling and managing changes to the ServiceNow platform, including configuration changes, application deployments, and system updates, to minimize disruptions and ensure proper documentation and approval.
4.6	Contractor: A contractor is a person who is hired by organization to work for an agreed term. Contractors are typically hired as a leased worker, purchased service worker, or independent contractor.  Contractors will typically have a organization employee as a sponsor who he or she reports to and will be given an internal access to organization network.
4.7	Credentials: Refers to the unique username and password or other authentication factors used to verify the identity of an individual accessing the ServiceNow platform.
4.8	Development Environment: A dedicated workspace or instance where developers can create, modify, and test customizations, applications, and configurations before deploying them to a production environment. It provides a controlled and isolated environment for development activities, ensuring that changes and enhancements do not impact the stability or functionality of the live production environment.
4.9	Independent Contractor: Independent contractors are self-employed individuals who provide specialized services or expertise to organization and other companies. They often engage in a consultant capacity due to special knowledge and should not be used where tasks can be handled by a leased worker. Independent contractors have a direct contract with organization for their services and are paid by the deliverables as opposed to by the hour.
4.10	Information Security: The practice of protecting information and information systems from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
4.11	Internet-Facing Application: Any organization application that is accessible on the internet, regardless of where the application is hosted.  For example, this would include applications hosted within organization, externally accessible applications in a cloud environment (regardless of the cloud provider), and mobile applications.
4.12	ITOM: IT Operations Management
4.13	ITSM: IT Service Management
4.14	Leased workers: Contingent workers who are employed by a 3rd party that specialize in supplying temporary labor. The primary use of leased workers is either to complement or provide coverage for existing employees.  Typically, the leased workers are billed to the business by the hour.
4.15	Least Privilege: The principle of granting users the minimum level of privileges necessary to perform their authorized tasks, reducing the risk of unauthorized access or accidental misuse.
4.16	organization IT Infrastructure: All computing systems and associated networks that are managed for or by organization IT to support the storage, transmission and/or processing of organization data.
4.17	Operational data: Datasets extracted from production systems.
4.18	PII: Personally Identifiable Information
4.19	Purchased Service Worker: Purchased service workers are provided pursuant to a purchased service arrangement with outside contractor. Business is outsourcing an entire service or project as opposed to supplementing existing workforce. Typically, they are billed on a per project fixed cost. 
4.20	Risk: A measure of the extent to which an entity is threatened by a potential circumstance or event, and typically a function of (1) the adverse impacts that would arise if the circumstance or event occurs; and (2) the likelihood of occurrence. 
4.21	Sensitive Information: Refers to any data or information that, if disclosed, altered, or accessed without authorization, could cause harm to individuals, the organization, or its stakeholders. This includes personally identifiable information (PII), financial data, trade secrets, and confidential business information.
4.22	ServiceNow Platform: The enterprise cloud platform used for IT service management (ITSM), IT operations management (ITOM), and business process automation (BPA) provided by ServiceNow Inc.
